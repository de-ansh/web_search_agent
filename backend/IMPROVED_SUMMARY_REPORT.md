### 🎯 **User Request Addressed**
> "Ok i think we need to only summarize the content from sources which were successfully scrapped in out search. and summarize in such a way that we can under the summry as a human, currently it feels breaking"

### 🔧 **Key Improvements Implemented**

#### 1. **Content Quality Filtering**
- **Before**: Included content from failed scrapes and fallback content
- **After**: Only uses successfully scraped, meaningful content
- **Implementation**: Added `_is_fallback_content()` function to detect and exclude:
  - "could not be fully loaded due to website restrictions"
  - "This page from [URL] appears to be a relevant resource"
  - "ConsentDetailsIABV2SETTINGS" (cookie consent pages)
  - Other fallback indicators

#### 2. **Content Cleaning and Processing**
- **Before**: Raw scraped content with cookies, privacy notices, navigation elements
- **After**: Cleaned, meaningful content ready for summarization
- **Implementation**: Added `_clean_scraped_content()` function that:
  - Removes cookie notices, privacy policies, sign-up prompts
  - Filters out very short sentences (likely UI elements)
  - Normalizes whitespace and formatting
  - Limits content length to prevent overwhelming the AI

#### 3. **Enhanced AI Summarization Prompts**
- **Before**: Generic "summarize this content" prompts
- **After**: Context-aware, human-readable prompts
- **Implementation**: Improved OpenAI prompts that:
  - Directly address the user's query
  - Generate flowing, natural prose
  - Avoid bullet points and fragmented text
  - Maintain professional but accessible tone
  - Organize information logically

#### 4. **Better Summary Formatting**
- **Before**: Technical format with generic source counts
- **After**: Human-readable format with named sources
- **Example**:

#### 5. **Improved Error Handling**
- **Before**: Generic "insufficient content" message
- **After**: Helpful, actionable error messages

  **Unable to generate summary for "your query"**

  Unfortunately, we couldn't successfully extract meaningful content from the search results. This could be due to:
  - Websites blocking automated access
  - Content behind paywalls or login requirements
  - Technical issues with content extraction

  Please try a different search query or check back later.
  ```

### 🔍 **Technical Implementation Details**

#### New Functions Added:
1. **`_is_fallback_content(content: str) -> bool`**
   - Detects content generated by fallback mechanisms
   - Prevents poor-quality content from being summarized

2. **`_clean_scraped_content(content: str) -> str`**
   - Removes website navigation and promotional content
   - Filters meaningful sentences
   - Normalizes formatting

3. **Enhanced `_perform_web_search_with_combined_summary()`**
   - Only processes successfully scraped content
   - Tracks source names for attribution
   - Generates human-readable summaries

#### AI Prompt Improvements:
- **Context-aware prompts** that understand the user's query
- **Natural language instructions** for flowing prose
- **Professional tone guidance** for accessibility
- **Logical organization** requirements

### 📊 **Quality Improvements**

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Content Quality** | Mixed (includes failed scrapes) | High (only successful scrapes) |
| **Readability** | Technical/fragmented | Human-readable prose |
| **Source Attribution** | Generic count | Named sources |
| **Error Messages** | Basic | Helpful and actionable |
| **Content Cleaning** | None | Comprehensive filtering |
| **AI Prompts** | Generic | Context-aware and detailed |

### 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

**Summary of React hooks tutorial 2024**

Based on information from 3 successfully analyzed sources (React Documentation, FreeCodeCamp, Dev.to):

React hooks are a powerful feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks include useState for managing component state, useEffect for handling side effects like API calls and subscriptions, and useContext for accessing React context. Modern React development in 2024 emphasizes the use of custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic, proper dependency arrays in useEffect to prevent infinite loops, and the useCallback and useMemo hooks for performance optimization.
